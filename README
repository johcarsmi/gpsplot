This is a small project which I use to plot data from a Garmin 
Oregon 450.

It takes a .gpx file and imports it and then allows the choice
of graphs that can be obtained from the data.

It uses the QwtPlot object from the QWT to present the graphs.

It is a perpetual work in progress!

The filedownloader code was taken straight from the Qt documentation site.

I added the track on a satellite image at a request and learnt quite a bit
doing it.
