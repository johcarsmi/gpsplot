This is a small project which I use to plot data from a Garmin 
Oregon. 

It takes a .gpx file and imports it and then allows the choice
of graphs that can be obtained from the data.

It uses the QwtPlot object from the QWT to present the graphs.

It is a perpetual work in progress!

The filedownloader code was taken straight from the Qt documentation site.
