# gpsPlot

This is a small project which I use to plot data from a Garmin 
Oregon 450.

### Description
It takes a .gpx file and imports it and then allows the choice
of graphs that can be obtained from the data.

### Dependencies
* It is written in __C++__ using the **Qt5** Framework.
* It uses the __QwtPlot__ object from the **QWT6** to present the graphs.

### Status
It is a perpetual work in progress! Having said that I have no immediate
plans to add any functionality at present (December 2015).
One idea I may have a go at is using the mouse to drag the plot-on-satllite 
to pan it.

### Credits
The filedownloader code was taken straight from the Qt documentation site.
